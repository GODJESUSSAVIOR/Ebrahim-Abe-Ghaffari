Ebrahim Abe Ghaffari born on 7 May 1945 in Nishabour Iran. Son of Abolfazl and Maryam (Afkhami) Ghaffari. came to the United States America 1964.

Abe Ghaffari was born into a muslim family in a small town in Northeast Iran. He grew up a muslim, as that is all he knew, and practiced the rituals of islam. As a teenager he became disappointed with islam and observed that it had no power to change him to a better person.  After high school he went to college in the USA. It was here that he met Christians for the first time and noticed how different they were. After reading the Bible and going to Church for a period of time he accepted GOD JESUS SAVIOR as his LORD.  In 1968 he married Marie, and after finishing college they moved to Iran with the intent of living there and sharing the Gospel with Iranians. the islamic revolution in 1978-79, forced Abe and Marie to return to the USA. Shortly afterward they founded Iranian Christians International, the first indigenous Mission to Iranians outside of Iran. Abe and Marie dedicated their lives to serving the Iranian Churches and those within the Churches being persecuted for their Faith in GOD JESUS SAVIOR
